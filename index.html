				<h2>Why Use Us</h2>
				<p>2020 is our 40th year in business since Johnathen and Madison
				Jackson started Durham House of Pets out of their barn in 1980. 
				With all of this experience, we've come to know our pets and 
				our communities very well. This allows us to sell the right 
				pets to the right people, knowing that at the end of the day 
				that dog, cat, or fish is going to be loved and treated 
				deservedly. If you're someone that truly cares about the 
				well-being of these animals, then look no further because we, at 
				DHOP, know for a fact that all pets go to heaven.<br>
				Nevertheless, we know that talk is cheap, which is why every one 
				of our stores is certified and inspected annually by PETA and IFAW
				to ensure our animals are receiving the best treatment possible.<br>
				Another great benefit to our work with rescue shelters, is that it 
				allows us to offer the most competitive pricing for our wide selection
				of animals. When buying from us, you will most often walk away with 
				pure-bred level quality pets at a much lower cost then any breeder 
				or black market distributer.<br>
				And as proud as we are in our pups, kittens, and minnows; 
				that is only part of what we do at Durham House of Pets. We 
				want to ensure that you have the equipment and supplies necessary 
				to provide your pets with a long, healthy life. That is why our 
				team stays up-to-date with the most innovative accessories and 
				healthiest, science-backed nutrition.<br>
				Given our relationship with our pets and customers, there is no 
				question as to where you should shop for the newest addition to 
				your family.</p>

				<h2>Our History</h2>
				<p>Durham House of Pets has been a staple in the Durham, 
				NH community and the most trusted local seller of pets to 
				your friends and neighbors for the last 40 years.<br>
				We simply would not be here today if it weren't for the
				love and support we'e recieved in Portsmouth, Londonderry, 
				and of course, Durham. It is worth noting, though, that our 
				current expansive operation all started in a family-owned barn 
				in Durham, NH in 1980.<br>
				Johnathen and Madison Jackson first began breeding dogs in 
				the 1970s. They would sell mostly to family, friends, and trusted
				members of the community. As popularity and demand grew, the Jackson's
				increased their inventory by partnering with the humane society to 
				foster and find homes for rescue dogs. This quickly developed into the 
				jackson family selling cats in addition to just about any rescue animal 
				in need of a home.<br>
				It wasn't long before the Jackson's outgrew their barn nd opened the 
				first official Durham House of Pets in 1985. Deeply seeded into the 
				fabric of Durham and the University of New Hampshire; our Durham office 
				and headquarters can still be found on 48, Main Street where Johnson 
				Jackson first cut the tape in 1985.<br>
				While some things stay the same, however, others change. In our case, 
				these changes were for the better as the Jackson family decided to make 
				Durham House of Pets a 100%, pure rescue dog vendor. A move that was 
				highly regarded as ahead of its time considering current perception 
				of dog breeders. Once again the town rallied around us as we were able 
				to expand to both Portsmouth (1998) and Londonderry (2000) at the turn 
				of the century.<br>
				Fast Forward today, we are a PETA and IFAW certified safe keeper and
				distributer of rescue animals as well as the largest seller of exotic 
				salt water fish in Southern New Hampshire! We take pride in our reputation
				with the local citizens and businesses of the communities we serve and will 
				continue to be a safehaven for man's best friends.</p>
