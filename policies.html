				<h2>Animal Care</h2>
				<p>In parternship with PETA, IFAW, ASPCA, and the Humane Society, Durham House of 
				Pets has implemented and adjusted a progressive, forth-right set of policies and 
				rules protecting the animals we shelter.<br>
				Making sure the dogs, cats, and fish in our stores recieve the most loving and 
				attentive care as possible is our first priority which is why every one of our 
				workers is certified in partnership with the Professional Animal Care Certification 
				Council before they can start working with our animals.<br>
				Further, we run a thorough background check on every customer before they are allowed
				to purchase and bring home one of our animals.<br>
				For your own safety, every dog and cat we shelter is kept up to date at all times 
				with vaccines and annual physical examinations.<br>
				This stern system of control certifies that every animal that comes through Durham 
				House of Pets is in the best hands possible, whether or not they find a loving home.
				</p>
				<h2>Financing</h2>
				<p>We, at Durham House of Pets and not animal breeders by any means. Because every 
				animal you buy from us, fish excluded, is a rescue; we are able to offer more affordable
				and competitively priced animals.<br>
				In the best interest of the animals, we do not discriminate amongst breed or other 
				physical characteristics. This is to ensure that every animal finds equally invested
				owners. The only variable that we base price off of is age, with puppies and kittens 
				being the most expensive- attached to a depreciating value as they age. </p>
				<p>Our animal apparel and food is financed using a competitive price strategy to offer
				pet owners the most reasonable prices for name-brand products amongst all retailers 
				and online vendors.<br>
	`			Our sales and savings vary by store and are never company-wide as we operate with 
				decentralized command to ensure customized care and operation at each of our locations. 
				If you hear of a special offering or discounted price with one of our products, you should
				first ask one of our dedicated employees if it applies to your store.</p>
